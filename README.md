# Book-Search-Engine

This project is designed to act as a book search engine that utilizes the MERN stack. Because of this it uses Mongoose, Express.js, React and Node.js as 
technologies to create everything. 

Currently, the project is in a state of displaying an application error while on Heroku. The build has been successful, however, because of the error, the 
live site is not up and running yet. I have not been able to fully troubleshoot the error yet but once that is completed then the project will be 
deployed live to Heroku.

Once it is fully deployed it will allow the user to search for a book series/title which will then populate the page with the results. The current API 
will be converted from a RESTful API to a GraphQL API that uses Apollo servers to complete all the routes. MongoDB will be used to store the data being
used. Express.js and Node.js will work together seamlessly to tie everything together and install required dependencies.
